> GAME OVERVIEW
> 
---



> Battle City is an action game where you control a tank and your objective is
> to destroy all the enemy tanks around you, while ensuring that your base
> isn't attacked. Your base is represented by the phoenix symbol and is always
> found at the bottom of the screen while the enemy tanks will appear at the
> top of the screen.

> The game is in top view. There are various items which also appear from
> time to time. One of these (the star) enables your tank to become more
> powerful and thus allows you to cope with the nightmare that the later
> stages are. But, of course, you return to normal once you lose a life and
> thus, you'll have to do your best to remain alive.

> Anyway, the game is very long but it needs only a short FAQ. No walkthrough
> is needed for this kind of game as it is very straightforward. Of course,
> the difficulty is another thing. Hope you enjoy my guide and it is of any
> use to you.

---



> ~ Press the directional buttons to move about. You cannot move diagonally
> > but can move up, down, left and right as long as nothing is blocking your
> > way..



> ~ Brick walls can be destroyed by firing at them. You will notice that the
> > enemy tanks will also destroy the walls to move on and to reach your base
> > as quickly as possible.


> ~ Grass doesn't count as an obsctacle. The tanks will appear to pass below
> > it.



> ~ Steel walls cannot be destroyed normally but you can do so once your tank
> > is at Level 3.



> ~ Water acts as an obstacle to your tank but your bullets will go over it.
> > So, you can be on one side of a water patch and still destroy a tank which
> > is on other side.



> ~ Your tank can level-up through Stars (refer to "Items" section). There
> > are 4 levels in all. Additional notes and the fourth level (which I
> > missed the first time) have been sent in by Sashanan).


> Level 1 : Default (you start as this and return to this level after dying)
> Level 2 : 1 stars
> Level 3 : 2 stars
> Level 4 : 3 stars

> At level 1, your tank is just a decent one with weak firepower. I guess
> that's why it's called default.

> At level 2, it gains becomes slightly stronger. Your bullets also come out
> faster, thus allowing you to face enemy tanks. Trying to destroy enemy
> tanks from a distance become relatively easier as opposed to the chore
> of doing the same thing with the Level 1 tank.

> At level 3, your tank becomes considerably more powerful. One bullet is
> enough to destroy a brick wall and you can even destroy steel walls. You
> are also faster and have the ability to fire 2 shots in quick succession.

> At level 4, your shots again gain in power (bricks disappear in a breeze)
> and you can now clear steel walls too. However, according to Sashanan
> again, the bigger enemy tanks still take 4 shots to disappear in a puff.

> Also, the tanks don't gain in speed as they move across the levels. It's
> just an impression, so don't let that fool you into turning into Rambo.

> ITEMS

---



> Grenade - All the enemy tanks will explode. It is always better to wait
> > before taking it such that a maximum number of tanks will be
> > destroyed. According to Sashanan, the disadvantage of picking up
> > the grenade is that you don't get any points for all the tanks
> > that are subsequently destroyed. Thus, if you are playing for
> > the score, it would be wiser to grab it only when there are a
> > few enemies on-screen (or maybe a couple near your base and it
> > would take forever to backtrack). As a side-note, you get 500 pts
> > whenever you get the grenade even if there are no tanks on-screen.



> Star    - Makes your tank stronger. Stars have an accumulated effect. Your
> > tank can evolve into a gigantic one with awesome firepower. You
> > can fire bullets in quick succession and the shots themselves
> > travel faster.



> Shovel  - Increases your base's defense. The brick wall will turn into a
> > steel one. Thus, your base is invulnerable during that time.
> > In addition, any gaps that may have been caused by enemy tanks
> > are filled by the steel wall, as pointed out by Sashanan. As
> > I later found out myself, the gaps remain full when the steel
> > wall reverts back to normal again. Nice!



> Clock   - Immobilizes all enemy tanks for a short period of time. You may
> > then safely destroy those. Once you've grabbed a clock item, it
> > affects everything. Even tanks which appear after you've taken
> > the item will be immobilized, provided the effect is still being
> > observed.



> Helmet - Makes you invincible for some time. Your tank will be surrounded by
> > a barrier and can take anything as long as the latter is present.



> Tank   - D'oh, a life-up! Don't miss those, you'll need them! :)

> ENEMY TANKS
> 
---



> There are 4 types of enemy tanks throughout the whole game. At the start
> of the game, you will logically encounter more A and B tanks but as you
> reach the later stages, tanks C and D will literally flood the screen! :)


> Tank A : These tanks are very easy to destroy and are quite slow. Firepower
> > is basically the same as yours when you start the game. Destroyed
> > in one shot.



> Tank B : These are the fastest tanks in the game but they are weak
> > defensively. They can be very annoying though as they'll travel
> > across the whole screen within seconds. Destroyed in one shot but
> > they are fast enough to avoid your bullets, so be careful!



> Tank C : Slightly stronger versions of Tank A and faster (but not as much as
> > B). These tanks also have the ability to fire two shots in quick
> > succession (same as your Level 3 equivalent).



> Tank D: Very sturdy tanks but they are also extremely slow , so you can try
> > to take advantage of this. These tanks also require several shots
> > before they explode. As pointed out by Sashanan, Tanks D merely
> > represent an obstacle to your own tanks. They don't necessarily
> > make for your base since they are so slow.

> HINTS & TIPS
> 
---



> Here are a few hints and tips which will help you in beating the game.


> ~ Be always on the look-out for tanks which will try to get to your base.
> > When this happens, backtrack immediately and take care of those tanks.
> > Remember, it's Game Over if they shoot at your base.



> ~ A cheap way of playing would be to remain at the top where the tanks
> > appear (they will do so to the left or to the right, and also in the
> > middle of the screen) but keep in mind that you can also lose this way
> > if 2 or 3 tanks show up at the same time.



> ~ If an item appears but you have to deal with some dangerous opponents,
> > scrap the item. Who knows what may happen while you are heading for that
> > item?!



> ~ At Level 3, you can destroy the steel walls. But don't forget that this
> > may be beneficial to the enemy tanks by allowing them to pass through
> > easily. Thus, don't abuse your new-found strength.



> ~ As stated by Sashanan, the number of tanks per level is fixed at 20.
> > If you used the grenade(s) to get rid of certain tanks, these don't
> > show up in the overview screen after you beat the level.



> ~ Don't let yourself get surrounded by the enemy tanks. This never works
> > and you will just lose. Of course, this doesn't apply when you are
> > invincible.



> ~ And finally, don't let the first stages of the game fool you. You will
> > soon find out that the enemy tanks have a good AI. In the first stages,
> > they may just run into you but later, some tanks will try to get you
> > to follow them and a few others will then head to your base. You have
> > been warned, Battle City isn't an easy game.



> ~ You obtain a life-up at 20,000 points (thanks to Sashanan for that info).
> > In previous versions of this guide, I had written that these lives
> > become available at every subsequent 20,000 points too but sadly, I was
> > wrong.



> ~ Finally, if you are thinking about a score objective, Sashanan was able
> > to net 80,500 at Stage 15. If you want to send me your score, feel free
> > to do so. My personal achievement is at about 60,000 but I rarely play
> > for score.

> Well, that's all there is to this guide! Battle City is a simple game but

> If you have questions, contributions or just want to give me some feedback,
